\title{format field names}
\usage{
idig_field_indexes(fields)
}
\arguments{
\item{fields}{list of field names supplied by user}
}
\value{
a list indexed by field name with two values: "data", a list of
field names from data and "indexTerms", a list of field names from
indexTerms
}
\description{
Format list of field names and indexes.
}
\details{
Some fields returned by the API contain lists or dicts. This function uses
a hard coded list of those fields (they are stored in ES with these types
so they are known for indexTerms) to generate a list pretty names and
indexes to the returned data OR to drop the fields if formating to a fixed
number of columns is not possible. R syntax note:
  l[["a"]][["b"]] == l$a$b == l[[c("a", "b")]]
Note: indexes assume that the returned JSON is unlisted() first and that
indexTerms and data lists are packed into a list with the keys "indexTerms"
and "data". Not exported.
